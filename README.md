### Before you start

### Goal of this exercise

Write some automated E2E tests for the TO-DO application using [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io). 

The goal is *not* to add full coverage, instead, focus on how to organize the code well in a way that is maintainable.
We care about clean and well organized code that would scale well if the application being tested grows into a big project.
